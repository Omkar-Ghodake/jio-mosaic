/**
 * AI Mosaic Engine Placeholder
 * 
 * The actual logic for the AI Mosaic engine currently resides in `lib/mosaicEngine.ts`.
 * This file serves as a conceptual entry point for the AI engine mode.
 * 
 * Future refactoring may move logic here, but for now, we strictly follow the rule:
 * "Do NOT refactor existing AI files".
